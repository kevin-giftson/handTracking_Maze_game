# handTracking_Maze_game

## Maze Game with Hand Gesture Controls

This project combines Pygame, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to create an interactive maze game where players navigate using hand gestures detected through their webcam. The game demonstrates how computer vision can be integrated into gaming for innovative and fun experiences.
